# sonos/amlogic haxx

here you will find some exploit & tool code that was part of my presentation
about the Sonos One @ Hack in the Box amsterdam 2023.

the EL3 exploit can be used to dump your OTP/eFUSE data.

sonostool can be used to get decryption keys for Sonos LUKS volumes as well as
fetch and decrypt OTA updates without using a sonos device as an oracle.

the EL3 exploit/bug is still 0day at the time of writing. (never reported to vendor)

enjoy!
